        The default notifications listed here will be used when a given project does not specify which events should
        trigger HipChat notifications. Please note that the default notifications are only sent if the HipChat
        Notifications Post Build Action is added to the job (otherwise the plugin won't get invoked). In other words: to
        utilize the default notifications, you'll need to do 3 things:
        <ul>
            <li>Configure default notifications in the global settings (i.e. here)</li>
            <li>Add the HipChat Post Build Action to the job where you want to trigger the default notifications.</li>
            <li>Leave the job level Notifications setting completely empty.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Notification types must occur only once within this setting.</p>
    <p>
        If the message template is left empty, the project's default message template will be used. If that's empty as
        well, then the plugin falls back to the default message templates.

    <p>The icon URL used with card provider notifications. If it's left empty, a default is provided.</p>
    <p>
        The message template may contain any normal build variable (using the <em>$VAR_NAME</em> notation).
        Additionally the following variables are provided for convenience:
